Easy!Appointments is a highly customizable web application that 
allows your customers to book appointments with you via the web. 
Moreover, it provides the ability to sync your data with Google 
Calendar so you can use them with other services. It is an open 
source project and you can download and install it even for 
commercial use. Easy!Appointments will run smoothly with your
